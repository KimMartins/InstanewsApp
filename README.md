# Instant News App

**Brief Description:**

The objective of this project is to get real-time news instantly.

_The challenge required solving for the API using the Ajax method to make asynchronous requests to API's and handle success/failure responses_.

**Technologies used:**

- HTML
- CSS & CSS Grid
- Javascript
- jQuery - Ajax
- Gulp

**Personal learnings:**

SASS requires a pre-processor, as browsers cannot interpret SASS code directly. I learned that when using SASS, the styling sheet can be compiled within a _.min_ file which compresses the outputs and ultimately speeds up the page. I also learned and took advantage of the SASS capability of nesting selectors within a nest.

Learning about SASS at first, seemed quite overwhelming and complicated, but its function is specifically made to simplify the workspace, be easier to read and overall aesthetically presentable.

I found that the Ajax method was hard to wrap my head around at first.
Once I understood the fundamentals of what an API is and how it operates, it clicked and I had that AHA-moment.

I learned that the Ajax method basically sends and receives data from a server asynchronous (in the backend) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing web page.
